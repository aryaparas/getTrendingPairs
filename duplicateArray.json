        "content": "Smart contract platforms are usually blockchains that host smart contracts or decentralized applications. Users can interact with different smart contracts on these platforms to perform various actions such as lending and borrowing funds, staking their assets or minting NFTs.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain and are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. To interact with these smart contracts, transaction fees may need to be paid and the amount and asset required will vary based on the platform’s architecture. Usually, the smart contract platform’s native token is used to pay for transaction fees. Some popular examples of smart contract platforms include Ethereum, Solana and Polygon.",

On the other hand, these tokens also function as a governance token for decentralized exchanges. Users can vote on proposals to shape the direction of the protocol based on the number of tokens held.
